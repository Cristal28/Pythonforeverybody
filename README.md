# PythonForEverybody
## Example Personal Project Problem Statement

Based on Python for Everybody Specialization

### Goals

-   Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization and advance with the knowledge needed to learn Python

### Boundaries / Scope

-   Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
-   Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures

### Success criteria

-   My own application for data retrieval and processing.
-   Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.
- Learning a new language as a result of completing this course.

### Constraints

-   I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.
- This is my first language, therefore there will be a learning curve with it.
- I work an average of 30 hours a week. This can be problematic if I don't plan time for homework to do. Most of my work will be done on the weekend along with prior homework from other classes.

### Assumptions

-   The courses will be available for the duration of the semester. (~12 weeks)
-   I will have all required software.
- I have both a laptop and desktop where I can work interchangeably with and therefore have time to work on it on the go.
-   I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.
- It will get to be hard as I have never programmed before and this will be my first language.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job
- Myself - It will help me improve on my future and provide a foundation for my future studies.

### Personal Timeline

*Week*
1. **Chapter One/ Chapter Two:** *(They are very similar material, as we're setting up for the course, so I combined both chapters)* We learned about why we program and how to set everything up so we can begin programming. I downloaded Python, Atom, and a text editor for this program. I got to get some hands on experience with the python editor/shell. It was a great introduction especially cause it featured the creator of the Python Language.
