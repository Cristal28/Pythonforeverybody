# PythonForEverybody
## Example Personal Project Problem Statement

Based on Python for Everybody Specialization

### Goals

-   Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization and advance with the knowledge needed to learn Python

### Boundaries / Scope

-   Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
-   Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures

### Success criteria

-   My own application for data retrieval and processing.
-   Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.
- Learning a new language as a result of completing this course.

### Constraints

-   I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.
- This is my first language, therefore there will be a learning curve with it.
- I work an average of 30 hours a week. This can be problematic if I don't plan time for homework to do. Most of my work will be done on the weekend along with prior homework from other classes.

### Assumptions

-   The courses will be available for the duration of the semester. (~12 weeks)
-   I will have all required software.
- I have both a laptop and desktop where I can work interchangeably with and therefore have time to work on it on the go.
-   I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.
- It will get to be hard as I have never programmed before and this will be my first language.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job
- Myself - It will help me improve on my future and provide a foundation for my future studies.

### Personal Timeline

*Week*
**WEEK One/Two)** (They are very similar material, as we're setting up for the course, so I combined both chapters)* We learned about why we program and how to set everything up so we can begin programming. I downloaded Python, Atom, and a text editor for this program. I got to get some hands on experience with the python editor/shell. It was a great introduction especially cause it featured the creator of the Python Language. 
**WEEK Three** During this week, I was taught how to get python to spit out "Hello World". By typing **print("Hello World!")** He also got into explainging what IF, Else, While, For, etc. or conditionals for us to get introduce them. He also showed us examples of them. This week was very uneventful as he was getting us ready to "think as a programmer." I feel like the comming weeks might be more insightful and educational.
**WEEK Four**  We started learning about expressions and how to work with them. For example he went over what a variable is, how it stores it's location and how the expressions are being evaluated. The Professor also explained the ways that some operations are prohibited. Such as adding a number to a string. I learned how string conversions are used **int() and float()**. On the third part of this week, we learned about using comments and how they don't interfere with anything. 
**WEEK Five** During this week, we were taught when to use if statements, how the else statement worked and how we can nest them using elif. I found this extremely important when working on homework as it showed us what each line meant and how he explained it as he went. I found that during week three he briefly mention it, but it was great to know what it was ahead of time (Early Exposure). I was taught those during class this week, but what I didn't know from class were try and except structures. These prove to be similar to If and Else statements. He described how they were similar, but how their "maps" looked differently. 
**WEEK Six** We learned more about the different functions in this week. We explained what a parameter is "A variable which we use IN the function DEFINITION
